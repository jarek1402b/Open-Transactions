This are instructions for the new, modern building.
Why: Very fast builds, debug, clang seems better compiler (speed,memory) generating better code (fast; C++11)
How: Use ~/local/ script that wraps and calls ccache + user-local newer clang and debug code
State: This functionality is now (2013-10) under development, see 
github https://github.com/rfree/Open-Transactions/ for unofficial version by rfree (me).



1. System installation
2. Once per-user (or system) dependencies installation
3. Main build
4. Fast rebuilding




1. See general instructions for your system - but and also install "clang" as in point 2.



2. 
a) clang
As user we recommend to build from sources clang compiler in some new version
e.g. at least clang 3.3 (as of 2013-10). We would advice to build it per-user, 
using 
PREFIX=$HOME/.local/
On debian 7 good setup is to system-wide install clang from repository (3.2)
and user-local build clang 3.3.

b) 3rd party libs like chaiscript - same as in the other tutorials

c) run our script utils/compiler-wrapper/install.sh (or you will be asked to 
run it when building. It will install the wrapper in $HOME/.local/bin as 
compile-cxx and other scripts.



3. For main build use 
./cmd/build.sh 0



4. Fast recompilations are done with e.g.
./cmd/build.sh 200
